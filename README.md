Udacity Front End Development Nanodegree Project

This is my Personal Blog Project that was required as part of the Udacity Front End Development Nanodegree program.
With this project I was required to design a mock Blog website to demonstrate my knowledge and skills learned in HTML, CSS, CSS Grid and Flexbox.
The project required we include (in-part); 
A partially working navigation bar
Working social links that lead to outside websites
The use of font styles and colors
Working with Images
and much more ...
